# Tracks

A **Track** is the execution container for a single prioritization effort. It holds the six stages of preparation (S1 Participation → S2 Pool → S3 Criteria → S4 Scales → S5 Values → S6 Ranking) and owns the sessions that produce ranked output.

Tracks can be **cycle-linked** (created inside a Cycle and governed by its phase) or **standalone** (independent of any Cycle, used for ad-hoc prioritization).

---

## Track stages

| Stage | Name | What it requires |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Participation | At least one participant added and participation locked |
| S2 | Pool | Item pool assembled and locked |
| S3 | Criteria | At least one criterion configured and criteria locked |
| S4 | Scales | All criteria have accepted value ranges |
| S5 | Values | At least one accepted value proposal exists for the pool |
| S6 | Tool-ready | All S1–S5 prerequisites met |

Use `GET /v1/tracks/:id/readiness` to check which stages are complete and what's blocking each one.

---

## List tracks

```
GET /v1/tracks
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:read`

**Query parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cycle_id` | uuid | Filter to tracks belonging to a specific cycle |
| `standalone` | boolean | `true` to return only standalone tracks |
| `page` | integer | Page number |
| `per_page` | integer | Results per page |

**Request:**

```bash
curl "$PAI_BASE/tracks?cycle_id=cycle-uuid" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAI_KEY"
```

---

## Create a track

```
POST /v1/tracks
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

Omit `cycle_id` to create a standalone track. Include it to create a cycle-linked track (equivalent to `POST /v1/cycles/:id/tracks`).

**Body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | **required** | Track name |
| `cycle_id` | uuid | | Parent cycle. Omit for standalone. |
| `description` | string | | Track description |
| `category` | string | | Item category this track evaluates |
| `altitude` | integer | | Altitude level (1–5) this track operates at |

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "$PAI_BASE/tracks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Strategic Initiatives — Q3",
    "cycle_id": "cycle-uuid",
    "category": "initiative",
    "altitude": 4
  }'
```

**Response:** `201 Created`

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "track-uuid",
    "workspace_id": "...",
    "cycle_id": "cycle-uuid",
    "name": "Strategic Initiatives — Q3",
    "category": "initiative",
    "altitude": 4,
    "is_standalone": false,
    "readiness_state": null,
    "created_at": "2026-04-01T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "meta": { "workspace_id": "...", "request_id": "..." }
}
```

---

## Get a track

```
GET /v1/tracks/:id
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:read`

---

## Update a track

```
PATCH /v1/tracks/:id
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

`cycle_id` and `is_standalone` are immutable after creation. All other fields can be updated.

---

## Delete a track

```
DELETE /v1/tracks/:id
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

---

## Get track readiness

```
GET /v1/tracks/:id/readiness
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:read`

Calls the `evaluate_track_readiness` RPC. Returns the readiness status for each of the six preparation stages with specific blockers for each incomplete stage.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "track_id": "track-uuid",
    "track_name": "Strategic Initiatives — Q3",
    "cycle_id": "cycle-uuid",
    "s1_participation": { "ready": true, "blockers": [] },
    "s2_pool": { "ready": true, "blockers": [] },
    "s3_criteria": { "ready": false, "blockers": ["Criteria not locked"] },
    "s4_scales": { "ready": false, "blockers": ["2 scale(s) not accepted"] },
    "s5_values": { "ready": false, "blockers": ["No values entered"] },
    "s6_tool": {
      "ready": false,
      "blockers": [
        "Prerequisites not met",
        "S3: Criteria incomplete",
        "S4: Scales incomplete",
        "S5: Values incomplete"
      ]
    },
    "all_prerequisites_met": false,
    "s6_ready": false
  },
  "meta": { "workspace_id": "...", "request_id": "..." }
}
```

---

## Sessions

### List sessions for a track

```
GET /v1/tracks/:id/sessions
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:read`

Returns all sessions with `track_id` set to this track.

### Attach a session to a track

```
POST /v1/tracks/:id/sessions
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

Calls the `link_session_to_track` RPC. If the track belongs to a Cycle, the session is promoted to `cycle_linked` and its `cycle_id` is set. Guards against linking a session that is already bound to a different cycle.

**Body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | uuid | **required** | Existing session to attach |

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "$PAI_BASE/tracks/track-uuid/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id": "session-uuid"}'
```

---

## Participants

Effective track participants are the union of: cycle direct users + cycle groups + track direct users + track groups. Use `GET /v1/tracks/:id/readiness` to see the effective count against the S1 requirement.

### List participants

```
GET /v1/tracks/:id/participants
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:read`

Returns `{ direct: [...], groups: [...] }` — direct user participants and group participants separately.

### Add a participant

```
POST /v1/tracks/:id/participants
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

**Body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | uuid | one of | Direct user participant |
| `group_id` | uuid | one of | Group participant |
| `role` | string | | `contributor` (default) or `facilitator` |
| `added_by` | uuid | **required** | Actor performing the addition |

### Remove a participant

```
DELETE /v1/tracks/:id/participants/:uid
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

`:uid` is either a `user_id` or `group_id`. The route tries both.

---

## Item pool

The item pool is the set of items eligible for scoring in this track. S2 readiness (Pool Formation) requires at least one item in the pool before scoring can begin.

### Get item pool

```
GET /v1/tracks/:id/item-pool
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:read`

Returns the `item_pools` rows for this track.

---

### Add an item to the pool

```
POST /v1/tracks/:id/item-pool
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

Adds an item to this track's working pool.

**Body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `item_id` | uuid | **required** | The item to add |
| `position` | integer | | Display order within the pool |
| `notes` | string | | Reason for inclusion or notes for the team |
| `added_by` | uuid | | User ID of who added this item |

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "$PAI_BASE/tracks/track-uuid/item-pool" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "item_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "notes": "High urgency — flagged by product leadership",
    "added_by": "user-uuid"
  }'
```

**Response:** `201 Created` — the created pool membership row.

---

### Remove an item from the pool

```
DELETE /v1/tracks/:id/item-pool/:itemId
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

Removes an item from the pool by its `item_id`.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$PAI_BASE/tracks/track-uuid/item-pool/a1b2c3d4-..." \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAI_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": { "track_id": "track-uuid", "item_id": "a1b2c3d4-...", "deleted": true },
  "meta": { "workspace_id": "...", "request_id": "..." }
}
```

---

### Lock the item pool

```
POST /v1/tracks/:id/item-pool/lock
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

Locks the item pool by stamping `pool_locked_at = NOW()` on all pool rows for this track. Locking is required for Stage 2 (Pool) readiness. Once locked, the pool is considered final for S2–S6 readiness checks.

**Optional body:** `locked_by` (user UUID)

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "$PAI_BASE/tracks/track-uuid/item-pool/lock" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAI_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "locked_by": "user-uuid" }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": { "track_id": "track-uuid", "locked": true, "pools_updated": 4 },
  "meta": { "workspace_id": "...", "request_id": "..." }
}
```

### Unlock the item pool

```
DELETE /v1/tracks/:id/item-pool/lock
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:write`

Clears `pool_locked_at` to re-open the pool for modifications. Re-lock when assembly is complete.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "data": { "track_id": "track-uuid", "locked": false, "pools_updated": 4 },
  "meta": { "workspace_id": "...", "request_id": "..." }
}
```

---

## Criteria

Criteria are the evaluation dimensions participants score items against (Stage 3 — Criteria Selection, Stage 4 — Scales). Each criterion maps to a `cycle_attribute_configs` row.

### List criteria

```
GET /v1/tracks/:id/criteria
```

**Scopes:** `cycles:read`

Returns all criteria configurations scoped to this track, including `attribute_key`, `range_status`, `range_value`, and governance role assignments.
